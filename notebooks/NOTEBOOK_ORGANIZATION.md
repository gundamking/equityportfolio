# 📓 Notebook Organization Summary

## 🧹 Cleanup Performed

### Moved to Archive
The following original R-based notebooks have been moved to `notebooks/archive/`:

1. **`CS636102_MidtermProject_AutkarshChandraNJIT_id_31536880.ipynb`** (120KB)
   - Original academic midterm project
   - R-based momentum trading strategy implementation
   - Basic portfolio management logic

2. **`EPM_Main.ipynb`** (24MB - very large!)
   - Extended version of the original project
   - Comprehensive analysis and implementation

3. **`EPM_Main _FINAL.html`** (1.1MB)
   - HTML export of the main notebook
   - Static version for easy viewing

4. **`Untitled.ipynb`** (62KB) and **`Untitled1.ipynb`** (39KB)
   - Development notebooks with experimental code
   - Various iterations and testing of trading strategies
   - Dividend analysis and fund management calculations

### Cleaned Up
- **Removed** `ipynb_checkpoints/` and `.ipynb_checkpoints/` directories
- These contained temporary Jupyter notebook checkpoints

## 📁 Current Notebook Structure

## 🔄 Migration Summary

| Aspect | Original (R) | New (Python) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Structure** | Single large notebook | Modular package |
| **Strategies** | Basic momentum only | Multiple strategies |
| **Documentation** | Minimal | Comprehensive |
| **Code Quality** | Academic | Production-ready |
| **Testing** | None | Unit tests included |
| **Examples** | None | Multiple demos |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run the demo**: `jupyter notebook notebooks/portfolio_analysis_demo.ipynb`
3. **Explore examples**: Check `examples/` directory
4. **Run tests**: `pytest tests/`

The project is now **professional, well-organized, and ready for GitHub showcasing**! 🎉
