# Archived Original R Notebooks

This directory contains the original R-based notebooks from the academic midterm project that served as the foundation for this equity portfolio management system.

## Files

### `CS636102_MidtermProject_AutkarshChandraNJIT_id_31536880.ipynb`
- **Original academic project notebook**
- Contains the initial implementation of momentum-based trading strategy in R
- Uses dplyr for data manipulation and analysis
- Implements basic portfolio management logic

### `EPM_Main.ipynb`
- **Main project notebook** (24MB - very large file)
- Extended version of the original project
- Contains comprehensive analysis and implementation

### `EPM_Main _FINAL.html`
- **HTML export** of the main notebook
- Static version for easy viewing

### `Untitled.ipynb` and `Untitled1.ipynb`
- **Development notebooks** with experimental code
- Contains various iterations and testing of the trading strategies
- Includes dividend analysis and fund management calculations

## Purpose

These files represent the **original academic work** that has been **transformed into a professional Python package**. The new implementation in the main project directory includes:

- ✅ **Professional Python architecture** with modular design
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation** and examples
- ✅ **Multiple trading strategies** beyond the original momentum approach
- ✅ **Risk management** and performance analytics
- ✅ **Backtesting framework** with optimization capabilities
- ✅ **Production-ready code** with proper error handling

## Migration Summary

| Original (R) | New (Python) |
|-------------|---------------|
| Single large notebook | Modular package structure |
| Basic momentum strategy | Multiple strategy implementations |
| Limited documentation | Comprehensive docs and examples |
| Academic code | Production-ready code |
| Manual calculations | Automated backtesting framework |

The new implementation preserves the core concepts while providing a much more robust, scalable, and professional foundation for equity portfolio management.
